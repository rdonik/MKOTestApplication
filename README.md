# MKOTestApplication

Test task from company «МКО Системы»

Application would ask Accessibility permission for application. After grant it you can continue using the application. 
It will open instagram application and get username from it to your app through AccessibilityService API. 
It may not work fine as you expected, cause even if you enter wrong username it would get it, but anyway eventually it will get right info.

Stack and technologies I have used in app:

- MVVM + Clean
- Dependency Injection - Hilt 
- Database - Room (SQLite)  
- Flow for channel with database.
